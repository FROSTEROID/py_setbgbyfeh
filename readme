It's my HellWorld python3 script. No license, nothing at all. 
Just a beam of code You can edit, distr, eat or even offer to someone else. :D
I call it Autofeh or AutoBG. You can rename it, of cource.

So, the script is based on "feh" program. It's not hard to find documentation about one.
Autofeh was made to randomly choose an image from a sent directory and to set it as a wallpaper.
Whet image is randomly choosed, it just executes in Your bash:
feh --bg-fill *fullImagePath*

CALLING WITHOUT ARGUMENTS
You can call the script without arguments and it will try to find it's config file
in "~/.scripts/autoBG/config.py". In that config file there it waits for just a line
like "IMAGESPATH = ~/images/wall". If You want to hold the config file in another
place, You can edit the code.

PASSING AN ARGUMENT
Yeah, just one. A path to Your lovely folder with Your lovely pictures.
As i already said, it must be like "~/images/wall". Yes, without a slash at the ending.

Dislike? Change!
